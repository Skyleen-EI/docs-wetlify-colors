## Contrast

:::info

To check the color contrast, you will find that AA vs AAA labels appear frequently. These are the different conformance levels for contrast checking based on WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards.

Level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text, and a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and UI components (such as form input borders). Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.

Double A (AA) compliance is the acceptable level of accessibility for many online services and should work with most assistive technologies.

Triple A (AAA) is the accessibility benchmark, which provides everything for full accessible compliance, which makes the difference between a pretty good experience and a great one that anyone can use.
