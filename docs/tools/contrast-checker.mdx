# Contrast Checker

Go in the [Contrast Checker](https://colors.wetlify.com/contrast-checker) tool.

The Contrast Checker tool allows you to check the contrast between two colors according to WCAG standards. It is useful for checking the contrast between text and background colors.

    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: '600px',
    borderRadius: '5px',
    boxShadow: '0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
    marginBottom: '0.5rem',
  }}
/>

On the left of the screen, you can change the background and text colors by editing the input or by clicking on the colored square to the right of the input.

Click on the **Improve** button to improve your color for a better contrast.

Bellow, you can see all the WCAG ratios and the global score of your color combination.

On the right of the screen, you can see a preview of your color combination.
